##intro

This repository conatins C++ code for implementation of PID controller. This controller give the input to the steering wheel so it keep the car at the middle of the road.
At first, the turning was by hand but after that i used twiddler algorithm to fine tune the performance.

##PID Controller

The PID control scheme is named after its three correcting terms, whose sum constitutes the manipulated variable (MV). The proportional, integral, and derivative terms are summed to calculate the output of the PID controller.
{\displaystyle K_{\text{p}}} is the proportional gain, a tuning parameter,
{\displaystyle K_{\text{i}}} {\displaystyle K_{\text{i}}} is the integral gain, a tuning parameter,
{\displaystyle K_{\text{d}}} {\displaystyle K_{\text{d}}} is the derivative gain, a tuning parameter,
{\displaystyle e(t)=\mathrm {SP} -\mathrm {PV} (t)} is the error (SP is the setpoint, and PV(t) is the process variable)

Proportional term
The proportional term produces an output value that is proportional to the current error value. The proportional response can be adjusted by multiplying the error by a constant Kp, called the proportional gain constant. It's teh easiest one to tune and notice. It' effect appear when we don't steer enough or steer to the other side.  
Integral term
The contribution from the integral term is proportional to both the magnitude of the error and the duration of the error. The integral in a PID controller is the sum of the instantaneous error over time and gives the accumulated offset that should have been corrected previously. The accumulated error is then multiplied by the integral gain (Ki) and added to the controller output. We can sense this when the car have a trajector so close to the target but don't match it.

Derivative term
The derivative of the process error is calculated by determining the slope of the error over time and multiplying this rate of change by the derivative gain Kd. The magnitude of the contribution of the derivative term to the overall control action is termed the derivative gain, Kd. It help in damping the oscillations in the system like when the car keep drifting off the middle of teh road with constant pattern.

## Tuning of PID
I started with Manual tuning so i could have a base to ran the turning algorithm on.
Effects of increasing a parameter independently
| Parameter	Rise time | Overshoot | Settling time | Steady-state | error | Stability | 
| Kp | Decrease | Increase | Small change | Decrease | Degrade | 
| Ki | K_{i}| Decrease | Increase | Increase | Eliminate| Degrade| 
| Kd | Minor | change | Decrease | Decrease | No effect in theory | Improve if Kd small |

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
